============== Overview ==================
The data files are typically labeled starting with a number "001,002,etc" which is simply an index of the recording "1st, 2nd, etc."  The remainder of the name is somewhat arbitrary.  I usually name it filtered indicating that I have filtered the traces.  The file is composed of a single variable called props (ie., properties) with all of the relevant information as fields.  The following is a description of each field.
(temp) means that this field is temporary use for the Intan_gui app and not likely to provide you with information about the file.
(depr) means it is depricated, may be present in some files but is no longer used for anything.
==========================================
show (depr)
hide (depr)
appfile = location of the text file listing the recently opened files.
scstyle = appearance properties of the scatter to represent the spike occurance
intan_tag = object identification tag of the figure.  
figsize = the size of the Intan_gui figure.  This is adjusted by the app based on the size of the monitor.
matfile = the name of the matlab file
intan = the data acquired by the intan computer (nerves and/or carbon fiber recordings)
intan.tm = the time vector of the original intan data.  This is likely different than the actual data that is stitched together with the VSD.
intan.data = the original data from the intan computer.  This data is encoded in uint16.  The key to decode it into double precision is intan.min and intan.d2uint. See the nested function out = convert_uint(data,d2uint,mind,vtype) in Intan_gui.m.
intan.min = the minimum data value when in double-precision.  This is used to convert from uint16 to double-precision.
intan.d2uint = the scale factor from uint16 to double-precision.
intan.ch = the name of the channels from the intan computer
intan.finfo = information of the original intan data
intan.notes = the notes typed for each recording session in the notes.xlsx found in each folder of the recording.
